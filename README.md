using streamlit:
/* Streamlit 
Use your new environment
Any time you want to use the new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the Pipenv file lives) and run:

pipenv shell
Copy
Now you can use Python and Streamlit as usual:

streamlit run myfile.py
Copy
To stop the Streamlit server, press ctrl-C.

When you're done using this environment, just type exit or press ctrl-D to return to your normal shell.
